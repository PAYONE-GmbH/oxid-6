## A Word on PSD2

At the time of Release, only Amazon Pay requires code changes to be compatible with the upcoming PSD2 regulation. However, you can configure the plugin for optimized conversion when using Credit Cards and 3-D Secure 2.0. For more info see our Remark on docs.payone.com https://docs.payone.com/display/public/INT/Oxid+6+Extension#Oxid6Extension-EnsuringMaximumConversionWith3DSecure2.0
